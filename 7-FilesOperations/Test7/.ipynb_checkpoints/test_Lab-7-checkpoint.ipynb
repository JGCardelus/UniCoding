    "The passwords are composed of 8 alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are asked to re-encrypt all passwords to avoid data leakage. To do this we must follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the information in the file passwords.txt\n",
    "2. Ask the user for a positive shift greater than 1 and less than 26\n",
    "3. Encrypt the password associated with each user\n",
    "4. Save back this information into a new text file called passwords_new.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "The encryption process consists of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Special characters (symbols) are not encoded\n",
    "* Alphabetic characters are encoded using the Julius Caesar method: \"In cryptography, Caesar's cipher, also known as  Caesar's code, or Caesar's shift, is one of the simplest and most widely used cipher techniques. It is a type of cipher by substitution in which a letter in the original text is replaced by another letter that is a fixed number of positions later in the alphabet. For example, with a displacement of 3, A would be replaced by D (located 3 places to the right of A), B would be replaced by E, and so on. This method owes its name to Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals.\" . So we must first ask for the number of characters to shift and then, replace in the password the resulting character. \n",
    "* The digits are coded with the same shift used to encrypt the alphabetic characters but supposing a circular shift in a sequence of digits of 0,1,2....8,9. That is, if the shift is 3, the digit 4 would be coded as 7 and the digit 9 would be coded as 2.\n",

    "Consider the numerical sequence as: 0123456789  \n",
